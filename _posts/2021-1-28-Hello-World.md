Elebird<sup>1</sup>: A large flying elephant.
- What is an elephant?
- Is elebird a subset of elephants or is it a state that all elephants can enter?

Elephant: A large terrestial mammal.
- What is terrestial and what is a mammal?

It is only after long literature search expeditions, do I understand that an elebird is a hope to find a large flying animal with thick grey skin and an unusually long nose that it can use to pick up objects among other uses.
This blog<sup>2</sup> is my effort to understand and write simply about the elebirds that I encounter in my research and document the journey undertaken to really understand them.

<sup>1</sup> Elebird is an concept invented by my mathematics professor, Prof. Prakash Mulbagal to emphasize why axioms are necessary in mathematics.
