title: Getting Started

Let us assume that in the study of living things, we know only two points, every living thing that looks like us is a human but every living thing is an animal. Particularly, do not know what an elephant is. If now, we come across the word, elebird<span id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</span>, formally defined as a large flying elephant (say), we have a myriad of questions!
- What is an elephant?
- Is elebird a subset of elephants or is it a state that all elephants can enter?
- How can an elebird be identfied?
- Where does one find an elebird?

So now, we pick the first question and find that an elephant is defined as a large terrestial animal (say). None of these words are in our vocabulary. So now we wonder, 
- What is terrestial?
- How to identify an elephant?
- If they specifically mention terrestial animal in the definition, can animals be non-terrestial? (okay, this seems like a classic rabbit-hole question, but I wouldn't know being a grad student :D)

As a graduate student, I often find myself scaling and augmenting such search trees repeatedly before I am able to explain a complex concept using the same set of vocabulary that I started with before coming across the concept. For example, an elebird is a large flying *animal* with thick grey skin, an unusually long nose that it can use to pick up objects among other uses, and, cannot breathe under water.

This blog<span id="a2">[[2]](#f2)</span> documents the elebirds of my research in as simple language as possible, in an effort to understand them better.
