title: Hello World!

Hi, I am roboticist42.
I am PhD student in DNA nanotechnology and biosensors.
I am most interested in how DNA origami sensors clip on cells and their in-situ lifecycles.

Previously, I worked in optimal control theory, which I absolutely love! In another life, I worked on embedded systems and instrumentation. I intend to leverage my control theory and instrumentation background for biosensors.

I have realized that when I talk about concepts in simple terms with minimum jargon, as if, explaining it to someone, I understand it much better.
DNA Nanotech is a whole new field for me!
So, this blog is my effort to explain, in writing, the concepts I learn, and therefore, understand them better.
