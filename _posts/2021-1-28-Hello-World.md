Elebird<span id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</span>: A large flying elephant.
- What is an elephant?
- Is elebird a subset of elephants or is it a state that all elephants can enter?

Elephant: A large terrestial mammal.
- What is terrestial and what is a mammal?

After an extensive literature review, do I understand that an elebird is a hope to find a large flying animal with thick grey skin and an unusually long nose that it can use to pick up objects among other uses.

This blog<span id="a2">[[2]](#f2)</span> is my effort to document the elebirds that I encounter in my research as well as the journey undertaken to really understand them.
