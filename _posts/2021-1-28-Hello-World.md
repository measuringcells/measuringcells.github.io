Hi, I am roboticist42.

I am PhD student in DNA nanotechnology and biosensors.

I am most interested in how DNA origami sensors clip on cells and their in-situ lifecycles.

Previously, I worked in optimal control theory, which I absolutely love! In another life, I worked on embedded systems and instrumentation. I intend to leverage my control theory and instrumentation background for biosensors.

I have realized that when I explain concepts to someone, I understand them much better.

DNA Nanotech is a whole new field for me!

So, this blog is my effort to explain the concepts I learn, and therefore, understand them better.
