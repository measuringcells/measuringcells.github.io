Hi, I am PhD student in DNA-based biosensors.

I study ways to make DNA origami sensors clip on cells to measure the forces acting on the cells and their in-situ lifecycles.

My other great academic love is control theory.

This blog is my record-keeping effort to read and review academic materials in DNA nanotechnology, control theory and adjacent fields.
